Extensions: 

1)In every level of Froggit there is an option to restart the game by pressing “r” whenever the game is over. This can be done if the player wins or loses the game. This can also be done on any level.

Game bug: 
Also note that after implementation of the Frog coroutine, the Frog slides whenever trying to move on the log whether up, down, left, or right. The frog has to move a bit in the direction the log is moving before it is actually able to move. You will notice what I mean while playing, however the frog detecting the water, hedges, and lily pad exits still all work just fine, just the movement of the frog is bugged while on the logs.
